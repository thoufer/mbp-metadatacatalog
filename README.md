# MBP-MetadataCatalog

MBP-MetadataCatalog is a web based application built using Pythons high-level web framework [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com).  

The purpose of this application is to provide a rich-user interface to collect information about data assets managed by  the migratory bird program.  When fully operational, the catalog will provide a list of data assets for which the MBP has primary responsibility, along with searchable metadata.  Ideally, this system would be compatible with [ServCat](https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/), USGS, and [data.gov](https://www.data.gov) metadata schemas.
